            <p>Students for the Exploration and Development of Space was founded in 1980 at MIT, Princeton University,
              and Yale University by Peter Diamandis, Robert D. Richards, and Todd B. Hawley and consists of an
              international group of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from a diverse range of
              educational backgrounds with their common interest towards space.
              SEDS envisions a space-faring human civilization and believes that the only way to achieve this would be
              to utilize the immense potential of our youth by empowering them.
              We, here, at SEDS India, aim to flicker the slightest interest that everyone has about space. We take a
              step forward to educate and inspire people to understand more about space.

            <p>Students for the Exploration and Development of Space or SEDS, for short, is a non–profit, independent student-based international organization which, true to our namesake, is dedicated to expanding our role in the development and exploration of space. SEDS-India, with its headquarters at VIT University, is the governing body of SEDS in India. It was started in 2004 at PIIT, Mumbai by Mr. Pradeep Mohandas, and Mr. Abhishek Ray.
                SEDS India is run by students, with chapters in VIT University (Headquarters), VELTECH Engineering College, SASTRA University, BITS Goa, Rajalakshmi Engineering College, and Kumaraguru College of technology and many more. Each chapter is responsible for making the vast concept of space widely acceptable among the young minds, with a vision to expand the frontiers of space exploration. Space, being the vast entity it is, holds so much that is yet to be discovered. The resources are infinite. This knowledge has to be spread across the nation. The fastest way is to enlighten the bright minds of today to ensure a safe tomorrow.
                <br><br>
                We at SEDS India have three divisions working in three directions: Core, Outreach, and Projects.<br>
                <br>
                CORE: One of the chapter’s main objectives is to generate interest by, educating people about the infinite possibilities of space, supporting a network of interested students. This is achieved through various seminars, conferences, and hosting workshops. The Core directly interacts with the students regarding various aspects of space. It is responsible for regularizing and organizing such events on mainstream ideas about space. The organization has also garnered quite the attention among students.
                <br>
                OUTREACH: The Outreach is responsible for organizing sessions in various schools forming space clubs as part of the "OneSpace" initiative where the kids are taught about basics regarding space starting with why astronomy is important to us till the big bang theory. It covers all the myriad topics which are taught keeping the age and prior knowledge of children in mind. The presenters are also a group of SEDS members who are also space enthusiasts.
                <br><br>
                PROJECTS: Projects Team try to explore various viable possibilities in the field of space and turn them into pursuable projects and research. The teams participate in different competitions such as ERC (European Rover Challenge), where rovers are built to withstand the harsh surfaces and circumstances on Mars and CANSAT, where a typical aerospace system is built, but in a comparatively smaller scale. The teams are also recognized for the projects and research work they take up individually or as part of reputed research institutes in the country.
                <br><br>
                The SEDS members are passionate about the development and exploration of space. A learner-centric ideal system is provided where the opportunities to expand the radius of knowledge by various sources such as news updates, speakers to name a few are common in all chapters. SEDS India has tried to expand its reach by grasping various opportunities to expand our knowledge by interacting with people from the space community and also spreading awareness about the development of space in schools as well as universities. The Permanent Trustee of SEDS India is Dr. Geetha Manivasagam, Professor, VIT University. The advisory panel has various accomplished dignitaries on its board, including the Associate Director of Vikram Sarabhai Space Center. SEDS provides a platform for students to improve their knowledge base, skill set, and hands-on experience and has also been a breather to escape from the routine.

            so much that is yet to be discovered. The resources are infinite. This knowledge has to be spread across the
            nation. The fastest way is to enlighten the bright minds of today to ensure a safe tomorrow.
            <br><br>
            We at SEDS India have three divisions working in three directions: Core, Outreach, and Projects.<br>
            <br>
            CORE: One of the chapter’s main objectives is to generate interest by, educating people about the infinite
            possibilities of space, supporting a network of interested students. This is achieved through various
            seminars, conferences, and hosting workshops. The Core directly interacts with the students regarding
            various aspects of space. It is responsible for regularizing and organizing such events on mainstream ideas
            about space. The organization has also garnered quite the attention among students.
            <br>
            OUTREACH: The Outreach is responsible for organizing sessions in various schools forming space clubs as part
            of the "OneSpace" initiative where the kids are taught about basics regarding space starting with why
            astronomy is important to us till the big bang theory. It covers all the myriad topics which are taught
            keeping the age and prior knowledge of children in mind. The presenters are also a group of SEDS members who
            are also space enthusiasts.
            <br><br>
            PROJECTS: Projects Team try to explore various viable possibilities in the field of space and turn them into
            pursuable projects and research. The teams participate in different competitions such as ERC (European Rover
            Challenge), where rovers are built to withstand the harsh surfaces and circumstances on Mars and CANSAT,
            where a typical aerospace system is built, but in a comparatively smaller scale. The teams are also
            recognized for the projects and research work they take up individually or as part of reputed research
            institutes in the country.
            <br><br>
            The SEDS members are passionate about the development and exploration of space. A learner-centric ideal
            system is provided where the opportunities to expand the radius of knowledge by various sources such as news
            updates, speakers to name a few are common in all chapters. SEDS India has tried to expand its reach by
            grasping various opportunities to expand our knowledge by interacting with people from the space community
            and also spreading awareness about the development of space in schools as well as universities. The
            Permanent Trustee of SEDS India is Dr. Geetha Manivasagam, Professor, VIT University. The advisory panel has
            various accomplished dignitaries on its board, including the Associate Director of Vikram Sarabhai Space
            Center. SEDS provides a platform for students to improve their knowledge base, skill set, and hands-on
            experience and has also been a breather to escape from the routine.
